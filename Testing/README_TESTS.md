# ðŸ§ª Automated Test Suite Documentation

This project includes comprehensive automated test coverage for all major API endpoints in the backend. The test suite uses **Pytest** with **FastAPI's TestClient** and is structured to mirror the app's modular routing (e.g. orders, products, reviews, etc.).

---

## ðŸ§± Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest
```
